## [Chester Designs](images/meeting-1/Scanned%20Document%2014-1.pdf)

A simple navbar at the top of every page in the booking system with Airline Name (Leftmost) and 🔍️Search Bookings [Login] rightmost (with login dynamically changing based on status)
A simple footer at the very bottom of every page in the booking system with complaints, faq and management buttons to access those pages and switch to management mode too.

I have a home page with the ability to enter a start + desitination airport at the top and set filters below it 

Once search is pressed, you will then be able to see a header of a date then a list of cards with takeoff and landing times, prices and select buttons will appear below before the next date apppears 

Once a flight is selected, the card would then move to the top of the screen and the booking process would commence with the rest of the page dedicated to its various sections.

This design included login flows for bookins which is not part of MVP or sprint 1.
