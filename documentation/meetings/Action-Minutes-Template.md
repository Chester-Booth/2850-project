**ACTION MINUTES TEMPLATE**

Action minutes record the steps toward achieving the NORC program’s strategic goals. Here is a template for keeping minutes in a manner that tracks what is getting done, not what is being said.  

Note: Please see Effective Meeting Management Tool for more discussion on the value and usefulness of minutes recorded in this manner and for a complete 10 step overview of conducting effective meetings.
