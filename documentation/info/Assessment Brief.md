**1 Assignment guidance** 

You will produce a web application based on one of several different system specifications. 

The specification will provide a basic high-level overview of the system. You will use this to help plan  a needs-finding discussion with a product owner, which you will then use to develop a  comprehensive set of user stories which will be prioritised, and developed to produce a working  webapp. 

You will work as a self-organising team, producing and iteratively improving a system based on your  initial needs-finding and from peer and product owner feedback. You will use different testing  methods including unit testing, UX testing and end-to-end testing throughout development and use  this to shape your development. 

As a group, you will select and use appropriate tools to manage your work, develop your code and  handle version control. You will also develop some minimal documentation, both of your system and  of your design and testing. 

You and your team will also be responsible for organising weekly team meetings and at least two  retrospectives throughout your project – minutes and actions will be taken for these meetings.  
**2 Assessment tasks** 

You will submit: 

\- A GitHub repository containing your codebase.   
\- A Wiki containing your documentation.   
\- An individual reflection.   
\- 5+ Weekly development diaries. 

Throughout the project, you will complete: 

\- One in-person check-in with your product owner   
\- Two online check-ins 

These will ensure that everyone is contributing and engaged, and any inter-team issues can be  highlighted and resolved. 

At the end of the project, you will produce a poster pitching your system and its features and  benefits, and you will also produce a demonstration of your system which will show your features,  building on your initial work producing personas and job stories. 

This will be presented in person to a member of staff. 

A breakdown of each deliverable is given below: 

**Codebase** 

Your final source code will be submitted. This should be working with no bugs on the main branch  (you may have issues on development branches), well documented with file- and function-level  comments used to ensure your code is maintainable and readable. Your code should be  consistently styled across files and functions, with suitable variable, class, and function naming. 

You must also test your code, and your tests will form a part of your assessed work. 

**Documentation** 

On your GitHub Repository you should have a Wiki containing your documentation including: 

\- meeting and retrospective notes   
\- personas   
\- job stories   
\- design and planning documents.   
\- database diagrams   
\- class diagrams 

These will not be ‘formal’ documents but rather a way for you to keep track of your own planning  and designs- you should not be producing these only to meet the specification, they will be  developed by your team throughout your project to agree on certain standards and designs. 

Your GitHub Project board will also form a part of your documentation – this should be used to both  track user stories through the project and for issue and bug tracking.  
You should keep older versions of these files as you adapt and modify them, with notes about any  changes justifying why they were changed. 

**Individual Reflection** 

Each week there will be a **portfolio task** of completing a weekly development diary – this is a short  set of reflective questions for you to answer on Gradescope and will help to evidence your work on  the project. 

**The project runs over 7 weeks (week 4 – week 11\) – you must complete a minimum of 5  weekly development diaries in this time in order to pass portfolio requirements.** 

To ensure that diaries are an accurate reflection of the week, there is a **strict time window** to  complete the previous week’s diary. 

At the end of the project, you will complete a short (\~2000 word) reflection on your personal growth  throughout the project. A template will be provided for this reflection, and you will be able to use  your weekly diaries to remind yourself of previous weeks. 

**Poster & Demo Session** 

At the end of the project, you will do a final presentation and demonstration of your work. You will be  pitching your system using a poster and a demonstration and should be prepared to talk about what  you did and parts of the system of which you are particularly proud. 

You will demonstrate your system- this should be a practiced professional demonstration which is  based on personas and job stories and demonstrates the full functionality of the system. This should  take around 15 minutes. 

This demonstration will be to 2 members of staff. 

**Check Ins** 

There are a total of 3 check-ins throughout the project. The first check-in is your in-person product  owner meeting where you will meet with your product owner and have an opportunity to discuss  your project and ask any questions needed for requirements gathering. Your attendance will be  monitored for this meeting. 

The other two check-ins will be online peer feedback check-ins completed through Feedback Fruits;  you will be asked to give a rating for each of your team members (and yourself) based on: 

\- Contribution   
\- Communication   
\- Quality of Work 

This will be an opportunity to reflect on the time since the last check-in, highlight any team issues to  us, and to recognise any team members who are contributing more than others.  
**Team Allocation** 

You will work in a team of 4, and teams are assigned using a survey tool which will match you  based on several criteria: 

\- Students who want to do the same projects (priority 1\)   
\- Students who have a similar timetable (priority 2\)   
\- Students with different working styles (priority 3\) 

This is designed to be the fairest way of creating groups, ensuring that you can work on the project  you want to, that you have time to do so, and that you are working with a range of different styles in  your group. 

You cannot change teams, and you will need to work with people who you may not know – this is  part of working life, and it’s a useful skill to learn how to get along with people who may have  different interests, personalities and styles than yourself. If you struggle with groupwork and find  yourself needing additional support, please reach out. 

In cases where there are serious disagreements, clashes, or unacceptable behaviour in a group,  please email the module leader ASAP.  
**3 General guidance and study support** 

**Team Working, Communication and Expectations** 

You will be working in a team, meaning that you need to ensure you are communicating with your  group and that everyone knows what everyone else is doing. You should have regular (weekly)  meetings and should have some more frequent informal communication about your work. 

Meetings are a chance to discuss any ongoing issues, make decisions about design or changes,  and make sure everyone is up to speed with where the system is. 

You will have a retrospective after each sprint which will be a way of changing working practices,  resolving any issues or conflicts within the group, and incrementally improving how you work as a  team. 

If you have serious conflicts within the group, or concerns about someone’s work, please raise them  in your check-ins or by messaging module staff. Where the concerns are minor (e.g. someone’s  code is not as high standard as expected) then please discuss this in group and handle this in a  professional way such as pair-programming with the team member and supporting them to improve.  

If someone does not engage with the work, does not communicate with the team, etc. please raise  this as early as possible to module staff. If that person does later engage with the group, please try  and include them- make sure they are assigned some work to do and try and integrate them into the  group. 

**Individual Working** 

At times, you will work alone on parts of the system or on code. You should ensure you are doing  this to the standards set by your group, following expected conventions, and not making large  changes to other peoples’ code without discussion. 

You should track what you are working on using your project board to ensure everyone knows what  everyone else is doing. 

**Use of Git** 

You will be using Git for version control throughout the module. You should, as a team, decide on a  strategy for how you will work – for example, whether you will use feature branches or developer  branches, and how pull requests on main will be handled. 

You should **not** program directly on the main branch – your main branch is for finished, tested,  working code only. Code should be developed on branches and pull requests used to merge into  Main only when tests have been passed, and code is confirmed to be working correctly.   
**Testing** 

You are expected to thoroughly test your code, both to ensure it does what you expect it to do, and  to ensure that you have considered a range of potential security risks. You should try and make sure  that there is no ‘unknown’ behaviour – if we consider the example of the Wordle portfolio task, this  involves asking yourself: 

\- How does my program react if the words.txt file is empty?   
\- How does my program react if the words.txt file doesn’t exist?   
\- How does my program react to empty user inputs?   
\- What happens if a word contains 4 letters, or numbers/special characters? 

Consider what may create exceptions in your program, how this should be handled gracefully, and  what you can do to prevent your user receiving error messages. Remember – you’re writing these  programs for a customer. 

You should also plan this with your team – think about how your classes and functions interact, and  where the best place to put validation will be and therefore where the tests should be.  

It is generally recommended that the person who writes the code should not be the person who  writes the tests. We also recommend trying test-driven development (writing the tests first). 

You may do some manual testing, for example testing full user journeys – in these cases, consider  how you document these, when they should be done, and how the feedback is given to the  developers.  
**4 Assessment criteria and marking process.** 

You will be marked based on: 

\- Documentation \[20\]   
\- Source code \[20\]   
\- Final produced system \[30\]   
\- Individual Reflection \[10\]   
\- Checks Ins \[10\]   
\- Poster Presentation and Demo \[10\] 

Full marking rubrics provided in Section 8\. 

**5 Presentation and referencing** 

**Code** 

You should follow basic standards for your code \- Kotlin code conventions. 

You may wish to use KDoc for richer in-code documentation. 

Tools such as Detekt and KLint will support you in finding and fixing any standardisation errors. **Writing** 

Your reflection is a relatively informal piece of academic writing, and you can use the first person (I,  me, my) if you would like to. The Library has a guide to reflective writing which you may find useful – you are expected to fully reflect and not simply give an account of what you did. 

Any references should be Leeds Harvard style – your in-text citation should include the author’s  surname(s) and the year of publication, with a corresponding item in the bibliography. 

You can find a full list of the correct bibliography styles for different types of media, including  websites, journal articles and books through the link above. 

**6 Submission requirements** 

**Codebase, Documentation & GitHub** 

Make all final commits and pushes **before** the deadline, as you will need to submit your final  repository by the deadline. 

**Weekly Diaries and Reflection** 

Weekly diaries will be submitted each week through Gradescope. The diary will open for submission  on Friday morning and will close the following Thursday afternoon. This gives you a week to write  each previous week’s diary. 

Individual reflections will be submitted via Gradescope at the end of the project. **Check-Ins** 

You will have a 2-week window to complete your online check-ins. These will be completed in  Feedback Fruits, through Minerva.  
**Poster Session & Demo** 

You will submit a PDF of your poster, and you will be required to attend the poster session and  demonstrate your system to staff on the day. 

**7 Academic misconduct and plagiarism** 

**Plagiarism and Academic Integrity** 

Leeds students are part of an academic community that shares ideas and develops new ones.  

You need to learn how to work with others, how to interpret and present other people's ideas, and  how to produce your own independent academic work. It is essential that you can distinguish  between other people's work and your own and correctly acknowledge other people's work.  

All students new to the University are expected to complete an online Academic Integrity tutorial and  test, and all Leeds students should ensure that they are aware of the principles of Academic  integrity.  

When you submit work for assessment it is expected that it will meet the University’s academic  integrity standards.  

If you do not understand what these standards are, or how they apply to your work, then please ask  the module teaching staff for further guidance. 

**By submitting this assignment, you are confirming that the work is a true expression of your  own work and ideas and that you have given credit to others where their work has  contributed to yours.** 

**Generative AI** 

This assignment has been rated **amber** for use of generative AI. This means that you may use  generative AI tools in a supportive manner. 

You can use generative AI to: 

\- Proofread and translate text.   
\- Generate spoof data for testing.   
\- Summarise and explain parts of the specification for your own clarity.   
\- Support you with debugging (suggesting where you may have made a mistake in your code,  or deciphering an error message) 

\- Supporting you with understanding a concept or piece of code which you are struggling with. \- Support you in developing front-end code 

You can use generative AI to support you with parts of the code which we don’t expect you to be  very familiar with such as front-end development; you should still test and ensure you understand  this code and **must** acknowledge where generative AI has been used. You should add a comment  stating which lines were written primarily by generative AI and which model was used.
