# Flight Booking System

Your team has been tasked with helping a new airline build a complete flight booking  web application. The system will allow customers to book flights easily and give the  airline tools to manage reservations and customer interactions. 

The application will consist of three main components: 

## 1. Booking System 

This section is the main part of the application, and it serves as the primary interface  for travellers. It must be direct, efficient, and reliable, as it directly influences  customer satisfaction. 

The booking system should include: 

• Search for a flight using departure and destination airports, travel dates, and  the number of passengers. 

• Select a flight, input passenger details (name and email), and proceed with  payment for the booking. 

• Review all bookings and reservation details whenever required. 

Optional enhancements, such as seat selection during booking and the ability to  cancel or modify reservations. 

## 2. Management System 

This section of the application is designed for airline staff to support efficient  operations and precise reservation management. 

This should include: 

• Track all reservations made via the system. 

• Track flight availability, cancellations, and changes. 

• Generate reports for administrators, including the number of bookings per  flight, the most popular routes, and peak booking times. 

## 3. User Interaction System

This section links customers to the management system, simplifying how users  handle their bookings and communicate with the airline. 

This should include: 

• Request modifications to bookings, such as changing flight dates or  passenger information. 

• Cancel flights and get confirmation of the cancellation.  
• Submit a complaint form to report issues concerning bookings. • Set Notifications to alert you when your requests are processed. 

## Extensions and Improvements

To achieve the highest marks for this project, you should complete not only the basic  requirements but also one or more additional features, fully integrated into the basic  system. 

Note that full credit will not be given where these are simply implemented by using  an existing package – these should involve some significant additional work.  

You may suggest your own additional features to your product owner, or you could  consider: 

• Develop a native Android application in addition to the web app. • Provide a visual map that displays the user's route with stopovers. • Show a graphical chart representing loyalty points, redeemed points, and  upgrade milestones.
